# Heart disease Predication using Machine Learning Algorithms

Heart disease Predication by using machine lerning algorithums by performing the comparitive analysis of the different machine learing algorithms that are the K-Nearest Neighbour , Support Vector Machine , Logistic regression , and random forest Algorithms. 
This Project is created as the Proof of concept for my Master of computer appliation Mini Project and the Aim of the Project is to  perform the comparitive analysis and we got the accuracy of 89.23% and we also The trial results verify that Random Forest algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy of 89.23% compared to other ML algorithms implemented. And also we deployed the machine learning model in the flask local server.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Dataset Used 
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date this Dataset we are gather by UCI Machine Learing Repsitory
